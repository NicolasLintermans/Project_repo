Project 1: Web scraping
  - Since I'm sometimes tempted to read more articles on Hacker News than I perhaps should, I figured it would be a great exercise to scrape the website itself.
    So, as of now, it only returns a limited amount of articles (those with a vote count of 500 and higher).


Project 2: Scripting
  - Thumbnail image --> convert to PDF --> merge PDFs --> watermark PDF --> send email as 'user notification'. Please also refer to user_notification.html
  - Password checker via API
