Summary:
  - Project 1: web scraping 
  - Project 2: scripting
  - Project 3: data science
  - Project 4: machine learning


Project 1: Web scraping
  - Since I'm sometimes tempted to read more articles on Hacker News than I perhaps should, I figured it would be a great exercise to scrape the website itself.
    So, as of now, it only returns a limited amount of articles (those with a vote count of 500 and higher).


Project 2: Scripting
  - Image handling and remote emails: thumbnail image --> convert to PDF --> merge PDFs --> watermark PDF --> send email as 'user notification'.
    Please also refer to user_notification.html.
  - Password checker via API: a requirement for the last part of previous project (sending remote emails) was to disable 'less secured apps' within Google user settings.
    Consequently, as it should, you receive a warning email from Google regarding the security of your account. As this is critical, a password checker via API may prove to be
    purposeful. *** Note: I do NOT recommend passing your own password, as it is still stored 'somewhere'. ***


Project 3: Data science
  - TBA
